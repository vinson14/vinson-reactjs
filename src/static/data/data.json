    "about": {
        "profile": "I am an Associate Financial Consultant with AIA Singapore (SP-HUX) since 2015 with experience in both personal and commercial insurance. I joined in 2015 whilst I was still an undergraduate in NUS and I have since generated more than $0.5mil in revenue. I utilise the logical thinking imbued in me as a student of engineering to deliver sound financial advice to my clients. \n \n Equipping myself with new skills in a variety of areas is something which I constantly do. Web development, machine learning algorithms, algorithmic trading, photography are some skills which I have taught myself through various platforms. I believe that constantly increasing my arsenal of skills and applying them in my life is the only way to thrive in today's fast-paced society.",
